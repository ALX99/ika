# Why Ika

Ika is a minimalist, plugin-driven API Gateway that puts you in control. It starts with a lean core focused purely on routing, allowing you to add only the features you need through plugins.

## The Ika Philosophy

> Start minimal, extend purposefully.

Unlike traditional API Gateways that come loaded with features you may never use, Ika embraces a different approach:

- **Minimal Core**: Only essential routing functionality in the base system
- **Plugin-Driven**: Add exactly what you need, nothing more
- **Developer-First**: Same powerful plugin API for both core maintainers and users
- **Future-Proof**: Extremely few dependencies ensure long-term stability

## Why Choose Ika?

### ðŸŽ¯ Focused Design

Everything beyond basic routing is a plugin. This means:

- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- Faster deployments with smaller binaries
- Better reliability through reduced complexity

### ðŸ”Œ True Extensibility

- Write plugins in pure Go
- Access the full request/response lifecycle
- Combine plugins to create powerful workflows

### âš¡ Performance First

Starting minimal means:

- Lightning-fast startup times
- Lower memory footprint
- Efficient request processing

### ðŸ§ª Quality Assured
